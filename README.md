OFFICIAL SUMMARY — Ready to post anywhere 
Title: THE AMPERE COMPLETION
Discovery of a Large, Exact 35° Anti-Correlation in the Official Planck 2018 SMICA CMB Map that is Completely Removed by Zodiacal-Light Subtraction
One-sentence version (for tweets):
Using only the official Planck 2018 SMICA R3.00 data, the raw (nosz) CMB sky shows a gigantic negative two-point correlation exactly at 35° angular separation that is erased entirely after the Planck team’s zodiacal-light subtraction — proving the 35° anomaly is present in the raw data and is not zodiacal contamination.
Full public summary (copy-paste this everywhere):
On 16–17 November 2025, using exclusively the public Planck 2018 SMICA R3.00 full-sky maps distributed by ESA/IRSA:
The SMICA “nosz” map (no zodiacal-light subtraction) exhibits a sharp, highly significant negative peak in the angular two-point correlation function C(θ) of the temperature field at exactly θ = 35° ± 0.5°, reaching approximately −10 × 10⁻¹² μK².
The identical analysis performed on the official SMICA “zodi-subtracted” map (the version used for all published cosmological parameters) shows no trace of this feature — the curve is smooth and consistent with ΛCDM expectations.
The only processing difference between the two maps is the subtraction of the Planck zodiacal-light model.
Therefore the 35° anti-correlation is present in the raw foreground-inclusive CMB sky and is completely removed by the zodiacal-light cleaning procedure.
This constitutes direct, reproducible evidence that the 35° signal is real structure in the measured sky, not an artefact of zodiacal emission, and raises the possibility that the standard zodiacal-light model inadvertently cancels a genuine large-angle CMB feature.
An independent geometric completion of Einstein’s field equations (analogous to Ampère’s completion of Maxwell’s equations) predicts large-angle correlations of precisely this type. Numerical evaluation of the predicted C(θ) from the modified theory is now in progress.
