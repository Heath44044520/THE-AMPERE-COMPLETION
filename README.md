OFFICIAL SUMMARY —  
Title: THE AMPERE COMPLETION
Using only the official Planck 2018 SMICA R3.00 data, the raw (nosz) CMB.
On 16–17 November 2025, using exclusively the public Planck 2018 SMICA R3.00 full-sky maps distributed by ESA/IRSA:
The SMICA “nosz” map (no zodiacal-light subtraction) 
The identical analysis performed on the official SMICA “zodi-subtracted” map (the version used for all published cosmological parameters) shows no trace of this feature — the curve is smooth and consistent with ΛCDM expectations.
The only processing difference between the two maps is the subtraction of the Planck zodiacal-light 
An independent geometric completion of Einstein’s field equations (analogous to Ampère’s completion of Maxwell’s equations) predicts large-angle correlations. Numerical evaluation of the predicted C(θ) from the modified theory is now in progress.
